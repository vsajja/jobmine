Unlike roles with similar names at the other companies, Test Engineers at Google aren't manual testers -- you write scripts to automate testing and create tools so developers can test their own code. As a Test Engineer, you navigate Google's massive codebase, identify weak spots and constantly design better and creative ways to break software and identify potential problems. You'll have a huge impact on the quality of Google's growing suite of products and services.\n\nYou use your knowledge of testing and testability to influence better software design, promote proper engineering practice, bug prevention strategies, testability, accessibility, privacy, and other advanced quality concepts across products.\n\nGoogle is and always will be an engineering company. We hire people with a broad set of technical skills who are ready to take on some of technology's greatest challenges and make an impact on millions, if not billions, of users. At Google, engineers not only revolutionize search, they routinely work on massive scalability and storage solutions, large-scale applications and entirely new platforms for developers around the world. From AdWords to Chrome, Android to YouTube, Social to Local, Google engineers are changing the world one technological achievement after another.\nResponsibilities\n",

NOW, WEâ€™RE CREATING THE FUTURE. ===\n\nTECHS ON THE BEACH\nOn April 14, 1981, in Honolulu, Hawaii, William â€œBillâ€ Melton incorporated his new tech company. The original intention was to provide a recourse for retailers whoâ€™d been swindled by people handing out bad checks. Bill's product was a kind of verification device using phone linesâ€”a verification phone.\n\nBut then a pivot. The credit card industry was relatively new at the time and processing was still being done with carbon paper. Bill saw a way to reduce costs for companies like Visa and MasterCard, while capitalizing on this new technology. Instead of verifying checks, we would provide local businesses a means to electronically process credit card payments. And thus, the Verifone payment device was born.\n\nNow, Verifone is one of the worldâ€™s largest POS terminal vendors and a leading provider of payment and commerce solutions. We operate in more than 150 countries and employ nearly 6,000 people globally. Our steady growth has come organically, through a dedication to innovation and strategic partnerships, as well as from savvy acquisitions.\nPOSITION SUMMARY: SOFTWARE QA ENGINEER\nYou will be responsible for defining the overall test plan, performing test execution and validation, and reporting on all assigned projects.

At Opus One Solutions, we pursue solutions that will change how countries access and distribute electrical energy. From microgrids that keep things running in the event of an outage to how Tesla's latest batteries can help accelerate the integration of renewable energy. From how electric utilities can optimize their operations and reduce their carbon footprint to how every homeowner will feed energy into a power grid fueling the electrical sharing economy.\n\nAt Opus One Solutions, we believe some of the best talent in the tech industry share our passion for delivering technology that matters and that will make a difference, in our lifetime and beyond. We want to work with people who love the complexities of software; who believe in its power to transform the world to a better place.\n\nGood people know that great ideas are everywhere and what matters most is practical execution. Turning vision into reality is the hard part. But, when itâ€™s creating technical solutions that support access to renewable energy, itâ€™s an engineering feat worth contributing to.\n\nOur tech stack\n\nOur tech stack is deep because we interact with real things in the real world where the outcome matters. Our systems collect, analyze and interact with other systems in real-time. Internally, the tools we use include Redmine, GitLab, BuildBot and homegrown Python-based test automation, all hosted on AWS. Externally, our software is deployed in high availability, enterprise environments delivered via RedHat. There is no shortage of interesting deployment and maintenance challenges!\n\nThe opportunity\n\nOpus One Solutions is looking for a Software Engineer who wants to be a key player on our Analytics team. The Analytics team blends real-time electrical grid measurements and a physics-based view of the network to generate meaningful data which in turn gives utilities the tools to plan for and operate more renewable energy on todayâ€™s grids. Reporting to our Team Lead, Sam Bull, the new Software Engineer will learn our technologies quickly. They will apply their analytical and programming knowledge to help us develop, test and launch new solutions as we scale and grow.\n\nWho are you?\n\nYou are an outstanding Software Engineer with exceptional abstract mathematics skills. You are a strong individual contributor who enjoys working autonomously and solving complex problems. Complex programming in multiple languages, imaginary numbers, optimization techniques, non-linear equations and object-oriented designs are well within your area of expertise.\n\nThis is an exciting opportunity to be deeply involved in implementing new solutions to how we can accelerate the integration of renewable energy. This is a chance to be on the forefront of new technology, developing our core intellectual property.\n\nWhatâ€™s in it for you?\n\nChallenges. The electrical power grid is a lifeline to millions of people. Quite literally, this is a system that cannot go down when it comes to hospitals, traffic controls and more. Your challenge is to enhance the data science. Itâ€™s programming, building the tools and the mechanisms, generating the algorithms and the analytics.\n\nPersonal and professional satisfaction. You want to do meaningful work. You donâ€™t just want to build and analyze things, you want to directly contribute to technology solutions that matter.\nWhat will our new Software Engineer work on? You will:\nUndertake quantitative development of sophisticated power systems algorithms that effectively take what amounts to Small Data and generates Big Data.\n\nLeverage that Big Data by analyzing and distilling it in ways that are meaningful to the people who are tasked with deploying renewables\n\nDevelop algorithms that incorporate dynamic changes to grid conditions in real-time without skipping a beat.\n\nDevelop ways to optimize renewable energy on the grid given a stochastic understanding of what will happen next.\n\nInterface with advanced modeling languages and optimization engines. Power systems are complex both literally (as in imaginary numbers) and figuratively!\nHereâ€™s what you bring:\nThe education. You have a degree in Computer Sciences.\n\nThe experience. You have 2+ years programming experience with a solid grounding in data structures, advanced algorithm design, OOD, and sound architecture..\n\nThe technical expertise. You have extensive hands-on experience with implementing numerical methods in multiple programming and modelling languages. You are a fast learner and can easily master Python, NumPy and 4th Generation ML software.\n\nThe passion. You are equally passionate about clean tech as you are about quality coding and mathematics.\n\nThe vision. You can focus on the big picture and the details. Robust, reliable and scalable is your motto.\n\nThe communication. You have exceptional written and oral communication skills. You are a strong presenter.\n\nThe energy. You thrive in a high volume, fast paced environment.\n\nThe innovation. You have the ability to anticipate problems and provide creative, quick - and reliable - solutions to complex problems.\n\nThe mathematical skills. Calculus. (That says it all really.)\n\nThe beneficial (but not mandatory) knowledge. You have an understanding of power systems, microgrids, energy pricing and demand.\n\nWhy join Opus One Solutions\n\nOpus One is growing! After spending the last four years under the radar focused on research and pilot projects weâ€™re ready to shine as one of Canadaâ€™s top 10 game-changers named by CIX Cleantech! We are deploying exciting microgrid projects in North America and have partnerships with leading energy players such as Tesla and Advanced Microgrid Solutions.\n\nCollectively, we are fanatical about the work we do. Our leadership has assembled carefully selected teams with some of the best strategic visionaries - and executors - in technology and the clean energy space. From the newest team member to the company founders, we are all driven by one common goal: to accelerate the integration of clean and sustainable energy in North America and the world.\n\nAs a team and a company, we are committed to working with like-minded people, with opinions and thoughts of their own that will contribute to our innovation and evolution.
